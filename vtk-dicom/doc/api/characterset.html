<p><a class="anchor" id="md_CharacterSet"></a></p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md7"></a>
Overview</h1>
<p>Even though it would be convenient for all DICOM files to store text in UTF-8, or even ASCII, the reality is that legacy character encodings are very common. Also, it is not uncommon to find DICOM files where the encoding does not conform perfectly with the standard. As a general rule, we want to be forgiving when decoding text in DICOM files, but we want to conform strictly to the standard when encoding text.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md8"></a>
ASCII and ISO-8859</h1>
<p>Many of the ISO-8859 character sets are supported (and extended) by Microsoft code pages, and have become closely associated with those code pages. The most important of these is CP1252 (Windows-1252) which extends ISO-8859-1 (ISO IR 100). This code page replaces C1 control codes, which are unused by the ISO-8859 character sets, with commonly-used characters such the Euro sign, combined OE and oe, and left and right quotes (single and double).</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md9"></a>
Decoding</h2>
<p>Our decoder supports the decoding of these extra code points when the character set is ISO IR 100. The rationale is that CP1252 is fully backwards-compatible with ISO IR 100, and the C1 control codes are not used by DICOM. This same rule is applied for ISO IR 148 (via CP1254) and ISO IR 166 (via CP874). ISO IR 6, however, is decoded strictly as ASCII.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md10"></a>
Encoding</h2>
<p>The extra characters that are supported by the decoder cannot also be supported by the encoder, since that would create files that do not conform with the DICOM standard. Encoding is done strictly according to the named character set.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md11"></a>
Japanese via ISO 2022</h1>
<p>The use of iso-2022 escape sequences for the encoding of Japanese text, referred to as "JIS encoding" began in 1978 and is still common (with restrictions) in the form of iso-2022-jp. DICOM's encoding of Japanese is also based on JIS encoding, but with different restrictions.</p>
<p>DICOM iso-2022 Japanese differs from iso-2022-jp most significantly in the optional inclusion, in DICOM, of ISO IR 13 in G1. This is done to support the use of half-width katakana in the traditional manner as described in JIS X 0201 and as commonly done in Japanese desktop computing and industrial computing.</p>
<p>The Specific Character Set defined term "ISO 2022 IR 13" indicates that the initial state of the decoder will be ISO IR 14 in G0 and ISO IR 13 in G1. Furthermore, the decoder returns to the initial state for every new line of text (that is, after every CRNL).</p>
<p>In this usage, <code>ESC )I</code> will re-designate ISO IR 13 to G1 (though it is not permitted to designate any other character set to G1), and <code>ESC (J</code> will re-designated ISO IR 14 to G0.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md12"></a>
Decoding</h2>
<p>Our decoder expands upon the JIS X 0208:1990 repertoire to include extra characters defined in Microsoft CP932 (including the NEC extension). If the defined term ISO 2022 IR 13 is present, then JIS X 0201 is used as the initial character set.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md13"></a>
Encoding</h2>
<p>Encoding of ISO-2022 Japanese in DICOM is usually done with the following defined terms for Specific Character Set:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>ISO 2022 IR 13\ISO 2022 IR 87</li>
<li>\ISO 2022 IR 87</li>
<li>\ISO 2022 IR 87\ISO 2022 IR 159</li>
</ol>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>This generally implies iso-2022-jp, but requires the use of romaji instead of ASCII, and also requires the use of JIS X 0208:1990 rather than any other version (such as JIS X 0208:1978 or JIS X 0208:1983). This provides exactly the same characters as classic shift-jis, with exactly the same method for encoding romaji and half-width katakana, but with a different way of encoding the JIS X 0208 characters.</li>
<li>This specifies the most widely used subset of iso-2022-jp, using only ASCII and JIS X 0208:1990. For broad compatibility, this is the best.</li>
<li>This specifies the most widely used subset of iso-2022-jp-2, like the above but adding JIS X 0212:1990 for additional characters.</li>
</ol>
<p>It is preferred to avoid the use of ISO 2022 IR 13 (and ISO IR 13), both because it requires romaji (not ASCII) in G0, and because half-width katakana are not supported by either iso-2022-jp or by iso-2022-jp-2. The romaji character set does not contain tilde or backslash, so when these characters are encoded when romaji has replaced ASCII, they become MACRON and YEN SIGN respectively.</p>
<p>For (2) and (3) above, when our encoder encounters half-width katakana, it will convert them to full-width katakana for ISO 2022 IR 87. For (1), or whenever ISO IR 13 is present, the half-width katakana will be encoded as-is.</p>
<p>Regarding the structure of the ISO 2022 encoding, our encoder will always switch G0 to ASCII (or romaji if ISO IR 13) before any ASCII character, including any control character except ESC. This includes SPACE and TAB as well as CR, NL, and FF.</p>
<p>Of course some tricky situations can arise when converting from UTF-8 to ISO 2022 Japanese, or even when converting from Windows CP932, which contains characters not present in JIS X 0208 or JIS X 0212. Firstly, ISO 2022 IR 13 should only be used if half-width katakana are present in the original text and cannot be avoided. Secondly, it is important to note that some characters might be converted to equivalents at different code points in order to make them compatible with either JIS X 0208 or JIS X 0212.</p>
<p>The following characters are considered to be compatible by our encoder, and will be converted if necessary to fit them into an encoding:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>MACRON and FULLWIDTH MACRON</li>
<li>OVERLINE and FULLWIDTH MACRON</li>
<li>YEN SIGN and FULLWIDTH YEN SIGN</li>
<li>CENT SIGN and FULLWIDTH CENT SIGN</li>
<li>POUND SIGN and FULLWIDTH POUND SIGN</li>
<li>MINUS SIGN and FULLWIDTH HYPHEN-MINUS</li>
<li>NOT SIGN and FULLWIDTH NOT SIGN</li>
<li>EM DASH and HORIZONTAL BAR</li>
<li>FULLWIDTH TILDE and WAVE DASH</li>
<li>PARALLEL TO and DOUBLE VERTICAL LINE</li>
</ol>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md14"></a>
Korean via ISO 2022</h1>
<p>Outside of DICOM, ISO 2022 escape sequences are generally not used in encodings of Korean. In fact, the euc-kr encoding is identical to DICOM's Korean encoding except that it lacks the escape sequences. Conversely, DICOM requires the escape sequence <code>ESC $)C</code> at the beginning of every line of text that contains Korean characters.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md15"></a>
Decoding</h2>
<p>Though required by the DICOM standard, the escape sequences are not present in all Korean DICOM files. Therefore, our decoder will simply remove the escape sequence wherever it is found, and decode the text using Microsoft CP949 (which is backwards compatible with euc-kr, which in turn is identical to DICOM ISO 2022 IR 149 except for the escape sequences). As compared to euc-kr, CP949 contains thousands of additional characters.</p>
<p>As well, KS X 1001 (and ISO IR 149) permit Hangul to be stored using 8-byte codes rather than 2-byte codes. This eight-byte code stores the character using four 2-byte component codes, and was necessary because ISO IR 149 did not contain enough code points for all characters used in Korean. Our decoder will convert each of these 8-byte codes into a single Unicode character.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md16"></a>
Encoding</h2>
<p>Our ISO 2022 IR 149 encoder places the escape <code>ESC $)C</code> sequence at the front of every line that uses Korean characters (or any characters from KS X 1001), as required by DICOM. Hangul that do not exist in KS X 1001 are decomposed and stored as 8-byte codes.</p>
<p>The following characters are considered to be compatible by our encoder, due to the various tables that vendors use to map KS X 1001 to Unicode:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>MIDDLE DOT and KATAKANA MIDDLE DOT</li>
<li>SOFT HYPHEN and EN DASH</li>
<li>HORIZONTAL BAR and EM DASH</li>
<li>PARALLEL TO and DOUBLE VERTICAL LINE</li>
<li>TILDE OPERATOR and WAVE DASH</li>
<li>FULLWIDTH CENT SIGN and CENT SIGN</li>
<li>FULLWIDTH POUND SIGN and POUND SIGN</li>
<li>FULLWIDTH YEN SIGN and YEN SIGN</li>
<li>FULLWIDTH NOT SIGN and NOT SIGN</li>
<li>FULLWIDTH TILDE and SMALL TILDE</li>
<li>CIRCLED DOT OPERATOR and FISHEYE</li>
</ol>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md17"></a>
Chinese via GB18030</h1>
<p>The GB18030 encoding was designed to encompass all Unicode code points. Every GB18030 code point maps to a unique Unicode code point and vice-versa, so round-trip encoding of all Unicode is possible. Since the ASCII backslash code (0x5c) can appear in GB18030-encoded strings as the second byte of a two-byte character, special consideration is applied when decoding multi-value data elements to ensure that 0x5c is only parsed as a separator when it appears as a single-byte character.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md18"></a>
Decoding</h2>
<p>Decoding is done strictly according to the GB18030:2022 mapping tables. Compared to GB18030:2005, 18 character code points that previously mapped to the PUA (Unicode Private Use Area) are now mapped to valid Unicode characters, and 6 other character code points that previously mapped to the PUA have been retired in favor of new (previously unused) code points for those same six characters.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md19"></a>
Encoding</h2>
<p>As with decoding, encoding is done strictly according to the GB18030:2022 tables. Unlike our encoders for other character sets, our GB18030 encoder does not perform any compatibility conversions. This is because every Unicode code point maps to a unique GB18030 code point.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md20"></a>
Chinese via GBK</h1>
<p>The GBK character table is a strict subset of GB18030, and does not encompass all of Unicode. Like GB18030, special consideration is used when scanning GBK strings for backslash, since the second byte of some two-byte characters can have the value 0x5c.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md21"></a>
Decoding</h2>
<p>Decoding is done per the GBK subset of GB18030, with one addition for compatibility with text that was encoded with Microsoft Code Page 936: the code 0x80 is mapped to the Euro symbol.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md22"></a>
Encoding</h2>
<p>Unlike GB18030, our encoder for GBK includes compatibility mappings for PUA codes that defined characters in older versions of the GB conversion tables. Our encoder does not encode the Euro symbol. See the section on the GB2312 encoder for compatibility mappings (all of these are used for GBK except for EM DASH and HORIZONTAL BAR, since GBK encodes both separately).</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md23"></a>
Chinese via ISO 2022 (GB2312)</h1>
<p>DICOM's ISO 2022 IR 58 is identical to the popular euc-cn encoding of GB2312, except that DICOM requires the use of <code>ESC $)A</code> at the beginning of every line containing characters from GB2312. Unlike GBK and GB18030, the second byte of a two-byte GB2312 character code will never be 0x5c (ASCII backslash), due to the fact that the high bit is always set.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md24"></a>
Decoding</h2>
<p>Decoding is done by removing the <code>ESC $)A</code> escape sequence and decoding as GB2312 in its euc-cn form. The table used for decoding is a strict subset of the table defined by GB18030:2022.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md25"></a>
Encoding</h2>
<p>Encoding involves adding the <code>ESC $)A</code> escape sequence at the beginning of every line containing Chinese characters, and then encoding as GB2312.</p>
<p>The following encoding equivalencies are used for compatibility with historical GB2312 to Unicode mapping tables:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>MIDDLE DOT and KATAKANA MIDDLE DOT</li>
<li>EM DASH and HORIZONTAL BAR</li>
<li>FULLWIDTH TILDE and WAVE DASH</li>
<li>DOUBLE VERTICAL LINE and PARALLEL TO</li>
<li>HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS and MIDLINE HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS</li>
<li>FULLWIDTH CENT SIGN and CENT SIGN</li>
<li>FULLWIDTH POUND SIGN and POUND SIGN</li>
</ol>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md26"></a>
Considerations for UTF-8</h1>
<p>When decoding UTF-8 data, there are a small number of important concerns. Foremost, the UTF-8 sequences must be checked for validity, and each sequence must decode to a code point between 0x00000 and 0x10FFFF. UTF-16 surrogate code points must be detected (0xD800 to 0xDFFF), since these are also invalid in UTF-8. Finally, any codes in the Private Use Area (PUA, 0xE000–0xF8FF) might need special consideration.</p>
<p>Our UTF-8 decoder simply re-encodes as UTF-8 after examining the string. That is, the decoder and the encoder are one and the same, and its only purpose is to check for invalid UTF-8 byte sequences and invalid Unicode code points. The PUA code points are simply passed through, as are any unassigned code points. </p>
