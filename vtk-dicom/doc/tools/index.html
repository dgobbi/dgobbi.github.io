<h3> <span id="dicomdump"> dicomdump </span></h3>
<pre>
usage:
  dicomdump file1.dcm [file2.dcm ...]

options:
  -k tag          Provide a key to be printed.
  -q &lt;query.txt&gt;  Provide a file that lists which elements to print.
  --help          Print a brief help message.
  --version       Print the software version.
</pre>
<p>Dump the metadata from a DICOM series as text.  If only a few
attributes are to be dumped, then their tags can be given with "-k"
(the "-k" option can be repeated as many times as needed).  Tags can
given in hexadecimal GGGG,EEEE format, or in text format as specified
in the DICOM dictionary.  Alternately, the tags can be listed in a
query file given with the "-q" option (one tag per line).
Attributes nested within sequences can be specified by giving a tag
path e.g. "-k Tag1/Tag2/Tag3".  Either a forward slash or a backslash
can be used to separate the components of the path.
</p>
<h3> <span id="dicomfind"> dicomfind </span></h3>
<pre>
usage:
  dicomfind [options] &lt;directory&gt; ...

options:
  -L              Follow symbolic links (default).
  -P              Do not follow symbolic links.
  -k tag=value    Provide an attribute to be queried and matched.
  -q &lt;query.txt&gt;  Provide a file to describe the find query.
  -u &lt;uids.txt&gt;   Provide a file that contains a list of UIDs.
  -maxdepth n     Set the maximum directory depth.
  -name pattern   Set a pattern to match (with &quot;*&quot; or &quot;?&quot;).
  -image          Restrict the search to files with PixelData.
  -series         Find all files in series if even one file matches.
  -print          Print the filenames of all matched files (default).
  -print0         Print the filenames with terminating null, for xargs.
  -exec ... +     Execute the given command for every series matched.
  -exec ... \;    Execute the given command for every file matched.
  -execdir ... +  Go to directory and execute command on every series.
  -execdir ... \; Go to directory and execute command on every file.
  --help          Print a brief help message.
  --version       Print the software version.
</pre>
<p>This command can be used to locate DICOM files.  It shares many
features with the UNIX "find" command.  When searching for files
with a specific attribute (with "-k"), the tag can be specified
in the form GGGG,EEEE or with its canonical name e.g. Modality=MR
from the DICOM dictionary.  Alternately, the tags can be listed in a
query file given with the "-q" option (one tag per line).
Attributes nested within sequences can be specified by giving a tag
path e.g. "-k Tag1/Tag2/Tag3".  Either a forward slash or a backslash
can be used to separate the components of the path.  Private tags
should be preceded by the private dictionary name in square brackets.
</p><p>The "-exec" and "-execdir" arguments cause dicomfind to run the
specified program on the found files.  For example, to dump each file
one would use "-exec dicomdump {} \;" where each instance of {} will
be replaced by a found file, and ";" indicates the end of the args
to dicomdump.  Alternately, if "+" is used to end the args, then the
program will be run on each DICOM series and {} will be replaced by all
files in the series.  The "-execdir" argument is similar, except that
it runs the program from within the directory of the file (or files),
and {} is replaced by just the filenames instead of with the full paths.

<h3> <span id="dicompull"> dicompull </span></h3>
<pre>
usage:
  dicompull [options] &lt;directory&gt; ...

options:
  -L              Follow symbolic links (default).

  -o &lt;directory&gt;  Directory to place the files into.
  -maxdepth n     Set the maximum directory depth.
  -name pattern   Set a pattern to match (with &quot;*&quot; or &quot;?&quot;).
  -image          Restrict the search to files with PixelData.
  -series         Find all files in series if even one file matches.
  --silent        Do not report any progress information.
  --help          Print a brief help message.
  --version       Print the software version.
</pre>
<p>Find dicom files in one directory and copy them to a new directory.
</p><p>The output directory given with &quot;-o&quot; can use DICOM attributes,
by naming those attributes within curly braces.  For example, consider
&quot;{PatientID}/{StudyDescription}/{SeriesDescription}-{SeriesNumber}&quot;
or something similar to produce a hierarchichal directory structure.
The attributes used in the path should be from the following list:</p>
<pre>
  PatientID, PatientName, PatientBirthDate, PatientSex,
  StudyID, StudyDescription, StudyDate, StudyTime, StudyInstanceUID,
  SeriesNumber, SeriesDescription, SeriesInstanceUID,
  Modality, AccessionNumber.
</pre>
<p>The files to be copied are specified with search keys, which take the
form &quot;-k key=value&quot; where keys can either use the standard names given
in the DICOM dictionary, e.g. Modality or SeriesDescription, or can be
in the form GGGG,EEEE with hexadecimal group and element values.  The
tags can also be listed in a query file with the &quot;-q&quot; option (one tag
per line). Private tags should be preceded by the private dictionary
name in square brackets.
</p><p>The values used for &quot;-k key=value&quot; can use the wildcards *
and ?, and can also use date ranges of the form &quot;19990103-19990105&quot;.
</p><p>The values used for "-k key=value" can use the wildcards * and ?, and
can also use date ranges of the form "19990103-19990105".
</p><p>
The "-u" option can be used to provide a list of UIDs.  Provide a file
where the first line of the file is the key (e.g. SeriesInstanceUID) and
the rest of the file is the UIDs to match, one UID per line.
</p>
<h3> <span id="dicomtocsv"> dicomtocsv </span></h3>
<pre>
usage:
  dicomtocsv [options] &lt;directory&gt;

options:
  -k tag=value     Provide a key to be queried and matched.
  -q &lt;query.txt&gt;   Provide a file to describe the find query.
  -u &lt;uids.txt&gt;    Provide a file that contains a list of UIDs.
  -o &lt;data.csv&gt;    Provide a file for the query results.
  --first-nonzero  Search series for first nonzero value of each key.
  --directory-only Use directory scan only, do not re-scan files.
  --study          Print one row for each study.
  --series         Print one row for each series (default).
  --image          Print one row for each image.
  --silent         Do not report any progress information.
  --help           Print a brief help message.
  --version        Print the software version.
</pre>
<p>Dump selected metadata from a DICOM directory to a csv file.
For each attribute to be extracted, the tag can be given with "-k"
(the "-k" option can be repeated as many times as needed).  Tags can
given in hexadecimal GGGG,EEEE format, or in text format as specified
in the DICOM dictionary.  Alternately, the tags can be listed in a
query file given with the "-q" option (one tag per line).
Attributes nested within sequences can be specified by giving a tag
path e.g. "-k Tag1/Tag2/Tag3".  Either a forward slash or a backslash
can be used to separate the components of the path.  Private tags
should be preceded by the private dictionary name in square brackets.
</p><p>
If the same tag is given more than once with "-k" (or if the tag is
listed multiple times in the query file, or appears in both the query
file and as a "-k" option), then its first appearance will set the
column number that it appears in.  Also, with regards to the search,
the value specified in the final appearance of the tag as an option
will be the value used for the search.
</p>
<pre>
# This is my query file
SeriesDate=2011-2014    # date range
SeriesTime
SeriesDescription=&quot;*T1*&quot;
PatientName
[GEMS_ACQU_01]0019,1084:DS # PeakSAR private tag with VR of DS
NumberOfReferences      # 0004,1600
ReferencedFileID        # 0004,1500
</pre>
<p>The query file consists of one attribute tag per line (in hexadecimal), along with the allowed values of the attribute and an optional comment.  If the attribute is private, then it must be preceded by the name of its private dictionary in square brackets.  There are two special attributes, NumberOfReferences (0004,1600) and ReferencedFileID (0004,1500), that must be included in the query in order to output the number of files in the series and the first filename in the series to the csv file.
</p><p>Attribute tags in the query file that are followed by "=" and a value are used to select which DICOM files to include in the output.  For example, <b>SeriesDate=2011-2014</b> means that the SeriesDate must be between 2011-Jan-01 and 2014-Dec-31 inclusive.  And <b>SeriesDescription="*T1*"</b> means that the SeriesDescription must contain the text "T1".  Attribute matching follows these rules:
</p>
<ol><li> Date, Time, and DateTime attributes can specify a range by using a hyphen.
</li><li> Other text attributes can be matched with a wildcard string, where "*" and "?" are the wildcards.
</li><li> If no wildcards are present, the match must be exact.
</li><li> Patient name matching does not require case (i.e. capitalization) to match.
</li><li> All text matching is done in utf-8 (non-utf8 text is converted to utf8 for matching).
</li><li> If the attribute is multi-valued, then it matches as long as one value matches.
</li></ol>
<p>If a desired attribute is buried within a sequence, then it can be specified as follows:

</pre>
<p>This program will convert a DICOM series into a NIfTI file.
</p><p>It reads the DICOM Position and Orientation metadata, and uses this
information to generate qform and sform entries for the NIfTI header,
after doing a conversion from the DICOM coordinate system to the NIfTI
coordinate system.
</p><p>By default, it will also reorder the columns of the image so that
columns with higher indices are further to the patient&apos;s right (or
in the case of sagittal images, further anterior).  Likewise, rows
will be rearranged so that rows with higher indices are superior (or
anterior for axial images).  Finally, it will reorder the slices
so that the column direction, row direction, and slice direction
follow the right-hand rule.
</p><p>It is also possible to reformat the images into the axial orientation
via the --reformat-to-axial option.  This option is mutually exclusive
with the no-reordering options.  The resulting orientation matrix will
be the identity matrix.
</p><p>If the output NIFTI files are to be used with the FMRIB FSL package,
then use the --fsl option to reformat the images to match the standard
FSL orientation: axial images with the slices arranged from inferior to
superior, column number increasing from right to left, and row number
increasing from posterior to anterior.  This will also convert the data
type from unsigned 16-bit to signed 16-bit if necessary.
</p><p>If batch mode is selected, the output file given with &quot;-o&quot;
can be constructed from DICOM attributes, by providing the attribute names
within curly braces.  For example, consider the following:
&quot;{PatientID}-{StudyDate}/{SeriesDescription}-{SeriesNumber}.nii&quot;
or something similar to produce a hierarchical directory structure.
The attributes used in the path should be from the following list:</p>
<pre>
  PatientID, PatientName, PatientBirthDate, PatientSex,
  StudyID, StudyDescription, StudyDate, StudyTime, StudyInstanceUID,
  SeriesNumber, SeriesDescription, SeriesInstanceUID,
  Modality, AccessionNumber.
</pre>
<p>Here is an example of batch mode that recurses into subdirectories
and compresses the output files, putting the results in the current
directory:

<p>This program will convert a NIfTI file into a DICOM series.
</p><p>It reads the NIfTI file header and does the best job that it can to
generate a series of DICOM files.  To help it along, you can provide
a DICOM file from the same series on the command line after the NIfTI
file, or even better, list all of the DICOM files that were used as
the source of the data in the NIfTI file.  Study-related meta data will
be copied from these DICOM files into the output DICOM files.
</p><p>Unless the --no-reordering option is provided, it will ensure that
the images are in the usual orientation (right is left, posterior is
down) by reordering the columns or rows as compared to the NIFTI file.
</p><p>If the NIFTI file is floating-point, then the data might be rescaled
when written to DICOM as 16-bit integers.  If any data values are too
large to fit into 16 bits, then all the data will be scaled down.  If
the data values all have a magnitude smaller than 2.05, then all the
data will be scaled up by a factor of 1000.

<p>This program allows adjustment of a DICOM series.
</p><p>In its most basic functionality, this command reads a DICOM series and
then writes it out with a new UID.  It strips out any meta data that is
not recognized as part of the SOP class that it is writing.  In other
words, its main purpose is to coerce the data to fit the requested SOP
class.
</p><p>Currently, only three output SOP classes can be written: Secondary
Capture, CT, and MR.  Enhanced CT and Enhanced MR cannot be written,
but they can be read, therefore this program can be used to convert
enhanced single-file CT and MR DICOM into a series of DICOM files.
</p><p>The written data has the ImageType set to DERIVED\SECONDARY\OTHER
and has a new series number and name.  It isn't meant to replace the
original data, it is simply meant to coerce the data into a format
that might be more compatible with other software.
</p><p>Reformatting of the data (MPR) is permitted during the conversion.
This is an experimental feature and causes much of the per-instance
meta data to be discarded.
